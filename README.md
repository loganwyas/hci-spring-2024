- To start frontend, run "npx expo start"
- To start backend, go into the "Backend" folder and run "node index.js"
- To allow the backend to connect to the frontend:
  - Use ngrok to create a public url for the api
  - Create a ".env" file
  - Add "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=$URL", replacing "$URL" with the public url that you created earlier
